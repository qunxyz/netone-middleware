0={0}: Id must be specified.
1={0} is already defined. Remove the duplicate entity or assign it a unique ID.
2={0} references an undefined {1}[{2}].
3={0}: Property {1} must be specified.
4={0}: Property {1} count incorrect: expected <{2}>, actual <{3}>.
5={0}: Property {1} value must be at least <{2}>.
6={0}: must have at least one start activity (one with no afferent (inbound) \
    transitions).
7={0}: must have at least one exit activity (one with no efferent (outbound) \
    transitions).
8=Activity[{0}]: the BlockActivity references an undefined ActivitySet[{1}].
9=Activity[{0}]: the SubFlow references an undefined WorkflowProcess[{1}].
10=Activity[{0}]: a Route cannot have a Performer.
11=Activity[{0}]: must include only one of: Route, Implementation, or BlockActivity.
12=Activity[{0}]: activities can only contain one synchronous deadline.
13=Activity[{0}]: is incompatible with Transition[{1}]/ExtendedAttribute[Execution].
14=Activity[{0}]: ExceptionName[{1}] is not handled by any efferent \
    (outbound) transition.
15=Activity[{0}]: TransitionRestrictions can only contain one Join.
16=Activity[{0}]: TransitionRestrictions can only contain one Split in OBE \
    (XPDL permits more, but does not define the semantics).
17=Activity[{0}]: a TransitionRef references non-efferent (non-outbound) \
    Transition[{1}].
18=Activity[{0}]: the Split does not reference Transition[{1}].
19=Activity[{0}]: the Split does not reference any transitions.
20=Transition[{0}]: OBE event transitions cannot be used in conjunction with \
    an XPDL transition type {1}.
21=Activity[{0}]: an OTHERWISE transition has already been defined.
22=Activity[{0}] has {1} afferent (inbound) transitions, and therefore \
    requires a Join.
23=Activity[{0}] has {1} regular efferent (outbound) transitions, and \
    therefore requires a Split.
24=Transition[{0}] references an undefined 'from' Activity[{1}].
25=Transition[{0}] references an undefined 'to' Activity[{1}].
26=Unable to determine DataType for ActualParameter[{0}]: {1}
27=Unsupported type conversion: from <{0}> to <{1}>.
28={0} is not a valid XPDL identifier (NMTOKEN).
29=Unsupported codepage: {0}.
30=Unsupported country: {0}.
31=Script[{0}] is not a valid script declaration. The script type is an \
    extended MIME Media Type and must start with \"text/x-\" or \"text/xml/x-\"
32={0} is not a valid type declaration: a type is required.
33=Invalid ValidFrom/ValidTo specification: {0,date}/{1,date}. \
    ValidFrom must pre-date ValidTo.
34=Activity[{0}] is in a FULL_BLOCKED WorkflowProcess and has an XOR-Split, \
    and therefore requires an OTHERWISE or unconditional transition.
